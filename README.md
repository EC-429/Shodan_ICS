# Shodan_ICS

The Shodan_ICS repository has been created to assist in identifying public facing SCADA/ICS IT Assets connected to the internet. 

Using the Shodan searches (i.e. Shodan_ICS_Searches.txt file) and the supplemental Vendor/product lists, one can easily identify assets via:
- Shodan.io web interface 
- Shodan script with API Key.

Obviously, these searches and lists are not exhaustive of all possibilities and will be updated when possible.
